# repl.it-govuk-prototype-kit

This template is intended to support runnig the [GOVUK Prototyping Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/) on devices that won't allow for a traditional install. It uses repl.it, a cloud based environment to host, edit and deploy your prototype.

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Create a free [repl.it](https://repl.it/) account and connect it to your GitHub account
3. Make a copy of this repo by clicking the **Use this template** button
4. Open repl.it and create a new repl.
5. Choose 'Import from Github' and select the copy you made at step 3

## Once the project has been added to repl.it

1. Create a username and password for your prototype by editing the existing .env file. Add the [following code](https://gist.github.com/jesseyuen/fa7743da8a1e7d3082c6319326744054), ensuring to personalise the username and password values. 
2. Click 'Run' and see what happens!

## Once the project is running

1. You can skip past the [Prototype ki install docs](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install), repli.t has done this for you.
2. Get started by learning how to [Build a basic prototype](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/start)

## Once you've made changes to your project

1. If you're happy with the changes, commit and push your work back to your GitHub repo
